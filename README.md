<p>RUAchievements will be an interactive, web-based project, in which students may earn
virtual “badges” in each of their classes, signifying their accomplishments.
After creating an account students will be able to view all badges that can be earned,
track the badges they’ve already earned, and view badges that their classmates have earned if
they desire.
In order to gain badges a student can sort through the list of all available badges and
determine which they have earned. Each selection of a new badge will submit a request for
confirmation to their professor. If the professor approves the badge request, the student will be
granted the new badge.
The goal of this project is to allow students to track their progress and accomplishments
in their classes and create a friendly competition between classmates to see who can earn the
most badges.</p>
